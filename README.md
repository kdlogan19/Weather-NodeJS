# Weather-App -NodeJS

This application is developed in curiosity to explore and get hands-on NodeJS and Express. 
I have used two APIs:
 1. Mapbox: to fetch the coordinates according to the location provided.
   
  2. Openweather: To return the weather information based on the co-oedinates provided.
   
This is also deployed onto Heroku.
